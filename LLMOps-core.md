# **Core LLMOps Job Skills**



##### I’ll break it into 6 pillars, each tied to tools you’ll need to learn:



###### 1\. Model Lifecycle Management



Training/fine-tuning → using frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, LoRA, PEFT.



Deployment → via Docker, Kubernetes, AWS SageMaker, or Ray Serve.



Inference optimization → Quantization (bitsandbytes, GGUF), batching, accelerators (GPU/TPU).



💡 Job ask: “Can you fine-tune an LLM for our domain and deploy it with auto-scaling?”



###### 2\. Vector Databases \& RAG



Already touched: FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus.



Integration with LangChain / LlamaIndex for orchestration.



💡 Job ask: “Build a chatbot that answers from company PDFs.”

###### 

###### 3\. Monitoring \& Observability



Metrics: latency, token usage, cost per request.



Tools: Prometheus + Grafana, Langfuse, Weights \& Biases, OpenTelemetry.



Guardrails: detecting hallucinations, bias, or prompt injections.



💡 Job ask: “How would you detect if the model is giving unsafe responses?”



###### 4\. Data \& Evaluation



Datasets: cleaning, splitting, versioning.



Tools: DVC (Data Version Control), MLflow.



Eval frameworks: Ragas, TruLens, custom metrics (accuracy, relevance, toxicity).



💡 Job ask: “How do you measure if our RAG pipeline is accurate?”



###### 5\. Security \& Governance



Don’t hardcode secrets (like we fixed earlier).



Use AWS Secrets Manager, Hashicorp Vault.



Compliance: GDPR, HIPAA (if sensitive data).



💡 Job ask: “How would you prevent API key leaks in a microservice?”



###### 6\. Cost Optimization



Use smaller models (Distil, 7B models) for cheap queries.



Offload to local inference (Ollama, vLLM, TGI) when possible.



Cloud: spot instances, autoscaling, caching embeddings.



💡 Job ask: “We spend $50k/month on GPT-4 API — how do we cut costs?”
